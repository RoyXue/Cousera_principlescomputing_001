this is Cousera Principle of Computing Week2 Mini Project

My score is 98.0/100.0, for a style warning (too many branchs in update_mc_scores) 

if u wanna get 100, just define a new method for scores updating process and call it in update_mc_scores will be ok

Actully I am a lazy guy, and I like my coding style :)
